# Endocasting from Micro-CT scans

This repository contains Python scripts for extracting digital endocasts from micro-CT scans of animal skulls (stored as NIfTI volumes). It was developed as part of our bachelor thesis at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

## What does it do?

These scripts process a NIfTI file (`.nii`) of a micro-CT scan to create a mesh-based digital endocast of an animal skull's endocranial cavity.

The main script, `script.py`, utilizes:

* PCA-based resampling of volume data.
* Identification of local maxima to determine a suitable center point.
* Iterative graph-cut methods to refine and generate meshes representing the endocranial cavity.

## How to use

1. Ensure you have Python installed, along with required libraries (see scripts).
2. Replace the paths in `script.py` with your file paths:

```python
path = "your_file_path.nii"          # Input NIfTI file path
out_path = "output_directory/"        # Output path for meshes
```

3. Optionally, adjust parameters like `num_iters` and `step_sizes`.
4. Run the script:

```bash
python script.py
```
